⚙️ **Day 11 of 30: Stop Building Scripts, Start Building Pipelines**

In Data Engineering, a script that works "on my machine" isn't enough. Production-readiness means **modularity, logging, and idempotency.**

For Day 11 of my 30-day challenge, I built a modular **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline Framework** that simulates an enterprise data ingestion flow.

🛠️ **What's under the hood:**
🔹 **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for Extract (API), Transform (Pandas), and Load (SQLAlchemy) to ensure unit-testability.
🔹 **JSON Normalization**: Handling nested API structures and flattening them into a clean relational warehouse.
🔹 **Resilience Layer**: Comprehensive logging and error handling. If a data source fails, the pipeline knows how to fail gracefully and log the "why."
🔹 **Data Enrichment**: Not just cleaning—transforming raw strings into actionable analytics fields.

This isn't just a "Python script." It's an automated factory for data.

**Recruiters:** I focus on building systems that don't just work—they SCALE.

## Posting Tips

1. **The Visual**: Post a clean screenshot of the **Mermaid Architecture Diagram** from the README. Visual pipelines are magnetic for Data Engineering recruiters.
2. **The Hook**: The transition from "scripting" to "engineering" is exactly what hiring managers are looking for.
3. **The Engagement**: Asking about "schema drift" shows you're thinking about real-world production problems.
